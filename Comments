1. There are 3 main classes , base class, driverfactory and capability Manager
 Base class test creates the driver
 Driverfactory class has the instance of driver that can be used acrss any test class. Any driver specific method or device specifc method should be
 put here such as settargetplatform, checking if android platform or ios, checking device os version etc

 Capability Manager have all capabilities of android and ios


 All basic operations such as scroll, click, sendkeys goes into Baseobjectopertions class which has an instance of driverfactory
 And all pageobjects class such as homepage extend Baseobjectoperations

 Using this framework we have everything decoupled.
